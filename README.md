Analysis of avalanches databases. Prediction with Learning algorithms.

# Abstract
Avalanches are a catastrophic event that occur very frequently in high mountains. 
Hundreds of people die of avalanches every year, even though security means are set in place every year to prevent those accidents: 
the risk of avalanches is calculated, and people are deterred to go on the dangerous slopes. 
Consequently, preventing avalanches risks is an important matter of security. 
We have chosen to use machine learning to study precisely avalanches risks, aiming to provide an algorithm more precise to determine avalanche risks. 
Indeed, our physical knowledge of avalanches and the data we dispose of are insufficient to carry out reliable predictions of avalanches. 
Therefore, the usual approach to the prediction problem is statistical and that is why machine learning can be very useful: 
it can help improve statistical models.
